A telescope that I designed at 15.

Electronics
- Arduino-based controller;
- Three synchronous electric motor (for pitch, yaw, elevation);
- One active-pixel sensor;
- ...

PM	Primary Mirror
f/1,45 (= F/D)
F = 2,175 m
D = 1,500 m
d = 0,300 m (18 hexagonal segments)
Reported diameter "d" is relative to circonference tangent each side of the hexagon.
The C3 segment is holed in order to make room for the AOS.
Shape: Parabolic hexagon

SM	Secondary Mirror
f/13,3 (= F/D)
F = 1,867 m
D = 0,140 m
Shape: Hyperbolic dish

System (PM + SM) | f/20

AOS	Aft Optical Subsystem
Contains the electronics.
